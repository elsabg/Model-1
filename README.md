# Model-1


License APACHE 2.0


The purpose of this model is to describe a microgrid in a context where the diesel
generator company (DGC) has full control. Accordingly, the DGC ought to make the decisions
regarding:
• The consumers and prosumers linked to the microgrid,
• The operations (dispatch) within the microgrid,
• The investment, rent, and retirement of technologies in the microgrid.

The premise of the model is that the DGC aims to maximize the present value of its profits by
making the above-mentioned decisions. By modeling this behavior, we generally aim to create an
optimization framework for swarm grids, in countries where the central government has less power
over the energy sector than individuals. A by-product of this analysis could also be the changes
in the optimal mix of rented (or fed-in) and owned capacities, as both rent and electricity prices
change.
